Welcome to the Sonar vs Rock Prediction Project! This project aims to predict whether underwater objects are sonar signals (mines) or rock signals using machine learning techniques.
Predicts whether an underwater object is a mine or a rock.
Utilizes logistic regression algorithm for classification.
Logistic Regression algorithm provides the better accuracy.
